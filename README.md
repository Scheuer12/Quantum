# Quantum

**Start with simple hydrogen atoms, and discover a whole universe on an intinitely tiny proportion (or not) in this incremental idle game.**

## üéÆ Concept

In **Quantum: As down as it's up**, you're trying to understand what's going on when you find a strange room with panels and devises that allow you to **fissure hydrogen atoms** to release **fundamental particles** and handle them. The game proceeds in layers of mystery, discovery and exponential production and satisfaction. What's beyond the particles?

You can:

- **Learn**: This game uses real physics principles (until it doesn't, but I'll let you know when... spoiler: we'll enter unexplored physic areas, for wich we dont really have answers in real world), some of them adapted for so playing this game doesn't become a physics phD research
- **Break Atoms**: to slice hydrogen atoms into protons, neutrons and eletrons (sometimes with some surprising subproducts...)
- **Process particles**: to create new, more complex particles, unlocking layers and evolving your technology.
- **Consume particles**: to convert them directly into **energy** (via E = mc¬≤), necessary to power the particle generators and sustain ongoing fission (and endgame features).

[**Spoiler Alert**]=======================

- **Produce Antimatter**: Create anti-particles, anti-substances, anti-planets, anti-cows and anti-universe(s).
- **Access Dimentional Strings**: Handle the String Theory to power your energy production.
- **Isolate Quarks**: Separate quarks from quark-gluon plasma (sci-fi) with absurdly powerful technology (and unimaginable amounts of energy).
- **Understand Hidden Truths**: Get to the very core of (sci-fi) physics engine.

This cycle creates a balance between **scientific exploration** and **resource management**.

## ‚öõÔ∏è Core Gameplay Loop

1. **Fission hydrogen atoms** ‚Üí release fundamental particles.
2. For each particle, choose to:
   - **Process** ‚Üí unlock new particles, open layers, and increase complexity.
   - **Consume** ‚Üí generate energy to power:
     - Particle generators
     - Hydrogen fissure reactors
     - Stabilization technologies

3. **Progression**: Use generated energy and particles to unlock new layers, mysteries and rewards.

## üß© Layer Structure

1. **Composites** ‚Üí protons, neutrons, atomic nuclei.
2. **Fundamentals** ‚Üí quark-gluon, bosons, pions.
3. **Sci-Fi Anti-matter** ‚Üí Anti-particles and anti-structures.
4. **Fundamentals Structure** ‚Üí Higgs Field, Strings Theory.
5. **Sci-Fi Universe Secrets** ‚Üí Discover and control universe's and reality's very core secrets.

## üî• Strategic Elements

- **Constant trade-off**: consume now for growth or process to evolve.
- **Energy management**: without sufficient energy, systems collapse.
- **Tech unlocks**: each new layer offers upgrades, automations, and new possibilities.
- **Efficiency**: technologies improve mass-to-energy conversion and reduce fission costs.

## üß† Game Philosophy

Quantum is not just about watching numbers grow.  
It‚Äôs about **absolute creative power**: transforming the simplest element ‚Äî hydrogen ‚Äî into the **entire cosmos**.  
It‚Äôs about **balancing features for the most efficient productive system**.

DISCLAIMER: It is completely possible to complete the endgame without spending a penny. Purchases are on the game for (and only for) your amusement and developer support (me :D)

## üßë‚ÄçüöÄ Who is this game for?

- Fans of **incremental and idle games**.
- Nerds passionate about **science, quantum physics, and cosmology**.
- Players who love **progression from extreme simplicity to mind-bending complexity**.
- Anyone who dreams of **creating a universe from scratch**.

## üìú License

This game is a sci-fi work loosely inspired by concepts from modern physics, including string theory, thermodynamics, and cosmology.  
It does not represent scientifically precise models, but it **respects scientific plausibility** as a conceptual foundation.

**Get ready. Creation starts with a single hydrogen atom‚Ä¶ and ends with a anti-universe different from all you could imagine.**
